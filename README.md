# Portfolio
This is my portfolio site, you can check it out [here](http://www.caaz.me/)!

## What's so special about this?
Well, I'm taking advantage of a Dart library, which I've wrote myself. It's called [Carbon](http://github.com/Caaz/carbon), and it's really cool, and hopefully simple enough to use. While this site may have a really cool front end, a lot of the work was done behind the scenes, so I suggest you check out that project if you're interested in seeing some of my actual coding skills.

## TODO
- An app on it's own page utilizing websockets.
