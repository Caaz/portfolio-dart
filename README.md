# Portfolio!
*Dart edition*

## What's this?
This is a portfolio site I've created for myself. Will it work? Who knows! That's the fun!

So why am I using dart? At the moment it's more just about simplicity. Look at that server code. Setup is simple as hell. I'm a fan of simplicity. For now this will do, eventually I may switch up to Rails if I need to add ridiculous things.
