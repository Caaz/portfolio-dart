      <h1 id='whoAmI'>Hi, I'm Daniel Cavazos, and I'm a <span id='iAmA'></span></h1>
      <p>Born and raised mostly in Fresno, California, I'm a self taught programmer. I picked up computers fairly early at the age of 5 or so, and tried out game developing at 10. I learned C with the help of some strangers online because my mom never taught me about stranger danger. Thankfully nothing creepy happened and programming became a great tool for me. Through it I found a real purpose in life and kept learning every chance I got.</p>
      <p>Around the age of 13, I stumbled upon IRC and was amazed by the bots crawling the networks. It was then that I learned Perl. I started writing my own IRC bots and It's become sort of an obsession to constantly rewrite the original program. Every time I rewrite it, the program gets more concise, and easier to build upon. At the time of writing, I'm starting to turn the project into a perl module so that things are more object oriented!</p>
      <p>Once I finally hit an age where people started considering me an actual person, I started college, and chose Web Development as my master almost entirely because I was too lazy to actually look at other choices. While I consider web development fairly easy and lacking in a challenge, I feel it's probably a decent career path, so why not.</p>
      <p>Game development is still really interesting to me however, and when I have time, I try to create nifty little games in java or javascript. I've even plans on making a MUD using Dart and some fancy WebSockets someday. Education will always come first though, so those kinds of projects are quite neglected.</p>
